# full-stack-site

 By combining your front-end UI with a back-end solution and cloud hosting, I built powerful and interactive full-stack application. I combined React, Node.js, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a full-stack, full-featured website, including user-friendly forms for posting articles and comments. I learned how to create an interface from React components, developed a Node.js server, tied in a MongoDB database, and deployed this site on Amazon Web Services. I developed the skills to take client services to the next level: full-stack web applications that are truly interactive.
